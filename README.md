# Generating synthetic tabular data with Generative adversarial network
### Bachelorâ€™s thesis

The purpose of this study was to create synthetic tabular data over a GAN that statistically resembles the original data, but does not contain any single point of measurement of the original data that could be identified by an individual. In addition, it was important to test and analyze the approaches and boundaries of the GAN network for the synthesis of tabular data.
